This project was developed to automate data extraction from multiple websites for purposes such as analysis, reporting, and storage. The scraping process handles both static and dynamic websites efficiently.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
  1. Python 3.x
  2. BeautifulSoup â€“ for parsing HTML and extracting data from static pages.
  3. Selenium â€“ for automating browser actions and scraping JavaScript-heavy content.
  4. Pandas â€“ for cleaning and storing data (optional, if used).
  5. CSV / Excel â€“ for saving scraped output.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
  1. Selenium uses a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver). Ensure it is installed and added to your system PATH.  
  2. Respect website robots.txt and terms of service.
  3. Add time delays or throttling to avoid overloading servers.
